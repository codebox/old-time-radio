TODO
----
mobile css for new pages
order of shows/episodes in list pages
re-do gemini-2.5-flash-lite episodes
add thumbs up/down for summaries
clean up episode summary text and remove this code: description.replaceAll("\\\"", "\"").replaceAll("\\n", "<br>")
SEO-ify episode page urls
check html metadata values and titles for new pages
add otter metadata to some shows
turn off debug logging

define cut-off point for match relevance, maybe send poorer results to client but hide them and allow user to show them if they want

move name parsing to backend, combine with otter data if we have it
cache summaries from otrData with long expiry - they will change very rarely

Search
------
jq 'map({(.id): .metadata.summary_small}) | add' response.json
jq 'map({(.id): {small: .metadata.summary_small, medium: .metadata.summary_medium}}) | add' response.json

update cache timestamps:
    find cache/shows -type f -exec touch {} +


Backend Rewrite
---------------
scenarios to check
    - fails to download show when not present is disk cache (ie when service starts for first time)
        - ok to crash
    - fails to download show on refresh
        - keep stale copy and try again next time
space patrol name parser doesnt add show name at the front

Tests
-----
To run jasmine tests, from the root of the projet do:
    jasmine --config=test/support/jasmine.json

- When everything on current playlist has been played, the API is queried again and playback continues
- When playing a show the Download as MP3 link is visible
- When not playing a show the Download as MP3 link is not visible
- Stop/start playing resumes at correct point
- Interrupting going to sleep process does not interrupt playback

Volume Control
- Volume is at max on first visit
- Volume + button is disabled on first visit
- Volume +/- are disabled/enabled correctly
- Volume is saved between page refreshes
- Adjusting volume before playing audio works correctly
- Volume is saved in browser storage and set next time site is opened

Sleep
- Sleeping message is displayed
- Periodic messages stop
- Volume fades out
- Triggering wake before sleep volume decrease completes, resets volume to pre-sleep level

Wake
- Volume restored to pre-sleep level
- Select channel message shown
- Periodic messages resume
- Message set to 'Select a Channel'

Schedule
- Schedule for playing channel is auto-selected when menu is opened
- Schedule is updated automatically if left open

Station Builder
- When listening to a custom station, schedule should show correct channels
