Backend Rewrite
---------------
scenarios to check
    - fails to download show when not present is disk cache (ie when service starts for first time)
        - ok to crash
    - fails to download show on refresh
        - keep stale copy and try again next time
space patrol name parser doesnt add show name at the front

Tests
-----
To run jasmine tests, from the root of the projet do:
    jasmine --config=test/support/jasmine.json

- When everything on current playlist has been played, the API is queried again and playback continues
- When playing a show the Download as MP3 link is visible
- When not playing a show the Download as MP3 link is not visible
- Stop/start playing resumes at correct point
- Interrupting going to sleep process does not interrupt playback

Volume Control
- Volume is at max on first visit
- Volume + button is disabled on first visit
- Volume +/- are disabled/enabled correctly
- Volume is saved between page refreshes
- Adjusting volume before playing audio works correctly
- Volume is saved in browser storage and set next time site is opened

Sleep
- Sleeping message is displayed
- Periodic messages stop
- Volume fades out
- Triggering wake before sleep volume decrease completes, resets volume to pre-sleep level

Wake
- Volume restored to pre-sleep level
- Select channel message shown
- Periodic messages resume
- Message set to 'Select a Channel'

Schedule
- Schedule for playing channel is auto-selected when menu is opened
- Schedule is updated automatically if left open

Station Builder
- When listening to a custom station, schedule should show correct channels
